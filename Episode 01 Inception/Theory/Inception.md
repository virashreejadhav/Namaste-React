## Episode 01 - Inception

1.  **What is a CDN and why do we use it?**

- A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a geographically distributed network of servers that delivers static assets like JavaScript, CSS, images, or videos to users based on their location.
- Instead of loading these resources directly from the origin server every time, a CDN caches them across multiple edge servers around the world. So, when a user visits a website, the content is served from the server closest to their location, which significantly reduces latency and load time.

### We use CDNs for several key reasons:

- **Performance**: Faster delivery of assets improves page load time and user experience.
- **Scalability**: CDNs handle high traffic more efficiently without overloading the main server.
- **Reliability**: If one server fails, others can serve the content, increasing availability.
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Since content is cached, it reduces the number of requests to the main server.
- **Security**: Many CDNs offer protection against DDoS attacks and support for HTTPS.
- For example, we often use a CDN to load libraries like React or Bootstrap by injecting it in an html file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
```

2. **What is crossorigin and why do we use it in React CDN ?**

- The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when we‚Äôre loading external resources, like a React CDN.
- When we load React from a CDN (which is a different domain), the browser treats it as a cross-origin request. The crossorigin attribute tells the browser how to handle credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) and whether to make a CORS request.
- **crossorigin** ensures that when we fetch React or other libraries from a CDN, we comply with CORS policies and allow the browser to securely verify the resource, especially when using integrity checks.

```html
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-xxxxx"
  crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

3. **What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via CDN?**

   **React.development.js**

- This file is the core of React.
- This file contains the whole code of React which is written in
  JavaScript.

  **React-dom.development.js**

- Using this file, React interacts with the browser DOM.

4.  **What is Emmet ?**

- Emmet is a developer tool and plugin available in most code editors (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) that helps you write HTML and CSS faster using abbreviations or shorthand syntax.

5.  **What is the difference between a framework and a library ?**

The main difference lies in who controls the flow of the application ‚Äî you or the tool.

- A `library` is a collection of pre-written functions or utilities that you call when needed. You stay in control of the application flow.
  **Example:** React is a library ‚Äî you decide when and where to use components or hooks.
- A `framework` provides a complete structure and dictates how your code should be written and organized. It calls your code at the right time.
  **Example:** Angular is a framework ‚Äî it defines the project structure, handles routing, and controls the entire flow.

### üîπ Simple analogy:

- Using a library is like hiring a helper ‚Äî you tell them what to do.
- Using a framework is like joining the army ‚Äî you follow its rules and structure.

6.  **Why is React named ‚ÄúReact‚Äù ?**

- React is abruptly named because it ‚Äúreacts‚Äù quickly to the changes without reloading the whole page.
- It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage.
- It‚Äôs built around components that ‚Äòreact‚Äô and update.

7. **What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?**

- `React` and `ReactDOM` are both packages provided by the React library, but they serve different purposes:

1. **React**

- Found in: react package
- Responsible for:
  Creating components
  Managing state, hooks, JSX, and component logic
- It provides the core functionality to build user interfaces.

  **‚úÖ Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

2. **ReactDOM**

- Found in: react-dom package
- Responsible for:
  Rendering React elements/components into the actual DOM.
  Bridging React‚Äôs virtual DOM to the browser‚Äôs DOM

- Used mostly in web applications.
- **‚úÖ Example:**

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

- **‚úÖ Summary:**

"React is used to build components and manage UI logic, while ReactDOM takes those components and renders them to the DOM in a browser environment."

8.**What is async and defer in <script> tags?**

- Both async and defer are attributes used in the <script> tag to control how external JavaScript files are loaded and executed in the browser ‚Äî especially to improve page performance.
- They are mainly used when placing scripts in the <head> to prevent render-blocking.

## Without async or defer:

- Scripts block HTML parsing.
- Browser downloads and executes the script immediately, then resumes rendering.

## async

- Downloads the script in parallel with HTML parsing.
- But executes it immediately once downloaded, which can interrupt HTML parsing.
- Suitable for independent scripts (like analytics, ads) that don‚Äôt rely on other code or DOM.
- **‚úÖ Example:**

```html
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
```

## defer

- Also downloads the script in parallel, but waits until HTML parsing is complete before executing.
- Executes in order (if multiple deferred scripts are present).
- Best for scripts that manipulate the DOM or depend on HTML being fully parsed.
- **‚úÖ Example:**

```html
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
```

## **‚úÖ Summary:**

- async loads and executes the script as soon as it‚Äôs ready, potentially before the HTML is fully parsed, while defer waits to execute the script after HTML is fully parsed ‚Äî making it safer for DOM-related operations.
