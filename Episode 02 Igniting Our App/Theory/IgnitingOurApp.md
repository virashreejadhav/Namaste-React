## Episode 02 - Igniting Our App

**1. What is NPM?**

- NPM is a package manager.
- A package manager for JavaScript (and especially for Node.js).
- It allows developers to install, manage, share, and publish code packages (modules).
- It comes bundled with Node.js, so when you install Node.js, you get NPM too.
  **It consists of three components:**
- The website
- The command line interface
- The registry
  **Use npm to:**
- adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Share code with any npm user anywhere.
- Restrict code to specific developers.
- Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance,coding and developers.
- Manage multiple versions of the code and code dependencies.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.

**2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?**

- Both Parcel and Webpack are JavaScript bundlers.
- They take your application’s JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc., and bundle them into optimized files that browsers can understand and load efficiently.

  **Why do we need a bundler?**

- In modern frontend apps, we write modular code using many .js, .jsx, .css, and other files. Browsers don’t support modules out-of-the-box efficiently, and loading 100s of files increases page load time.
- Tools like Webpack and Parcel solve this by:
- Bundling everything into a few optimized files.
- Handling module resolution.
- Transpiling code (like JSX/ES6 to browser-compatible JS using Babel).
- Minifying code for faster loading.
- Supporting hot reloading during development.

**Summary**

- We use bundlers like Webpack or Parcel in modern web development to improve performance and manage complexity. For example, in a React project, I might write JSX, use ES6 imports, and include SCSS or images. The browser doesn’t understand these directly. Parcel/Webpack handles bundling, transpiling, optimizing assets, and reducing file sizes. Parcel is great for quick setups with zero config, while Webpack is better for custom setups and larger apps.

---

**3. What is .parcel-cache?**

- .parcel-cache is a folder created by Parcel to store compiled files and dependency graphs for faster builds. It speeds up development by caching unchanged files, so only modified files are rebuilt.

---

**4. What is npx?**

- npx is a tool that comes with npm. It allows us to run Node.js packages without installing them globally. For example, npx create-react-app runs the CLI tool directly without polluting my system.

---

**5. Dependencies vs devDependencies**

- mostly we put libraries needed by the app at runtime in dependencies, and tools used only for development (like linters or test frameworks) in devDependencies.

  - dependencies -> Used in production -> E.g., react, axios
  - devDependencies -> Only used in development -> E.g., eslint, webpack

  ***

**6. What is Tree Shaking?**

- Tree shaking is a process to remove unused or "dead" code during bundling. Tools like Webpack or Parcel analyze imports and remove functions or modules that aren’t used, reducing final bundle size.

---

**7. What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?**

- HMR exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is
  running, without a full reload.
- This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:
  - Retain the application state which is lost during a full reload.
  - Save valuable development time by only updating what’s changed.
  - Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to the css/js file in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser’s dev tools.
- How does it work in the application ?

  - The application asks HMR runtime to check for updates.
  - The runtime asynchronous downloads the updates and notifies the application.
  - The application then asks the runtime to apply the updates.
  - The runtime synchronously applies the updates.

  **8. List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.**

- Zero-config setup ✅
- HMR ✅
- Fast caching ✅
- Code splitting
- Built-in support for TS/SCSS/JSX

**Describe 3:**

- Zero-config: Auto setup, no config files needed.
- HMR: Real-time UI updates without reload.
- Caching: Speeds up rebuilds by storing outputs.

---

**9. What is .gitignore? What should/shouldn't be added?**

- .gitignore tells Git which files or folders to exclude from version control like:

  - node_modules/
  - .env (secrets)
  - .parcel-cache/
  - dist/ (build output)

---

**10. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json**

- package.json -> Lists dependencies, Editable by devs
- package-lock.json -> Locks exact versions, Auto-generated by npm

---

**11. Why shouldn’t modify package-lock.json manually?**

- It’s auto-managed by npm. Modifying it can break dependency resolution or cause mismatched versions.

---

**12. What is node_modules? Should we push it to Git?**

- node_modules is where npm installs all dependencies.
- ❌ It should never be pushed to Git—it’s huge and platform-specific. The correct dependencies are tracked in package.json, and devs can use npm install to recreate it.

---

**13. What is the dist folder?**

- dist stands for “distribution.”
- It contains the final production-ready, optimized version of my app after bundling—this is what gets deployed.

---

**14. What is browserslist?**

- It’s a config that tells tools like Babel or PostCSS which browsers to support. This helps generate compatible code (e.g., for older browsers).

  ````json
  "browserslist": [
  "> 0.5%",
  "last 2 versions",
  "not dead"
  ]```
  ````

---

**15. Different Bundlers Parcel vs Webpack vs Vite**

- A bundler is a tool that takes your application code (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, etc.), and combines and transforms it into optimized files (bundles) that the browser can load efficiently.

`1. Webpack (The Configurable Workhorse)`
🔹 Overview:
Webpack is a highly configurable and widely adopted bundler. It uses a concept of entry points, loaders, and plugins to transform and bundle code.

🔹 Key Features:

- Manual configuration (webpack.config.js)
- Loaders: Handle files like .js, .css, .scss, .ts, etc.
- Plugins: Add additional functionality (e.g., minification, environment setup)
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking
- HMR with webpack-dev-server

🔹 Ideal For:

- Large-scale enterprise apps where you need fine control over build processes.

⚡ 2. Parcel (Zero-Config, Beginner-Friendly)
🔹 Overview:

- Parcel is a zero-config bundler that automatically detects file types and handles most setup behind the scenes. It’s known for simplicity and fast startup.

🔹 Key Features:

- Zero configuration
- Built-in support for JSX, TypeScript, SCSS, etc.
- Automatic HMR
- Fast build caching with .parcel-cache
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- Multi-threaded builds

🔹 Ideal For:

- Developers who want quick setup with minimal configuration for small to medium projects.

🚀 3. Vite (Next-Gen Fast Dev Server + Bundler)
🔹 Overview:

- Vite is a modern bundler focused on fast development experience. It uses native ES modules for dev and Rollup for production builds.

🔹 Key Features:

- Lightning-fast dev server using native ESM
- Instant HMR
- Uses Rollup internally for optimized production bundles
- Minimal configuration
- Framework-aware (e.g., Vite + React/Vue templates)

🔹 Ideal For:

- Modern frontend projects that need fast reloads and modern tooling with Vue, React, or Svelte.

## Summary:-

Parcel is great for quick starts with zero configuration. Webpack offers full control and is highly customizable, best for large-scale apps. Vite is a modern tool built for speed, using native ES modules and ideal for today’s frontend frameworks like React and Vue.
